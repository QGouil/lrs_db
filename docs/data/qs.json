                description: "Native DNA sequencing with nanopore allows the detection of certain base modifications in the electric signal. Nanopolish performs well on CpG methylation. Raw fast5s are basecalled with Guppy and mapped to a reference with Minimap2. Nanopolish uses the raw signal in the fast5 files along with the read mappings to produce a tsv file containing methylation calls at individual sites for individual reads, which can be further analysed or used to create a bisulfite-like bam file with nanopore-methylation-utilities for data exploration in IGV. Alternatively, a second nanopolish output file (the per-position summary of methylation) can be slightly rearranged to resemble a Bismark Coverage summary and loaded into Seqmonk for data exploration and analysis",
